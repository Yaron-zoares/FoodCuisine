# Language Support Documentation

## Overview
The FoodAPP supports both English and Hebrew languages. Users can switch between languages using the language selector, and all recipes can be displayed in their preferred language.

## How the App Works

The application allows users to search for recipes by ingredients, filter results by cuisine, dish type, and dietary preferences, and view recipe details. When a user enters ingredients or keywords, the app displays matching recipes. Filters can be applied to narrow down the results. The language selector enables users to instantly switch the interface and recipe information between English and Hebrew. All user interactions and displayed content update according to the selected language.
